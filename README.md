# VirtualTourist

Virtual Tourist allows users to specify travel locations around the world, and create virtual photo albums and places for each location. Users are able to drop pins around the world. As soon as a pin is dropped the Photo data for the pin location is  fetched from the Flickr API and stored in Core data.Tapping a pin allows users to access a photo album view that lets them view and edit an album of images for a location displayed in a collection view.
